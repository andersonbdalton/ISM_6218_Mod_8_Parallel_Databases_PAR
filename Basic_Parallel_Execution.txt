-- This script file illustrates the basics
-- of parallel execution in an Oracle DBMS.
-- Parallelism is a natural fit in relational
-- database environments (from any vendor).
-- Large-scale queries, index creation, and
-- other expensive operations often benefit
-- from parallel execution.

-- Step 1: Create a table if you have not
-- already done so as part of your earlier work.
-- This is easy using a CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
-- (or CTAS) statement.

CREATE TABLE movies AS
SELECT * FROM relmdb.movies;


-- Step 2: Run a simple query.
-- Even a simple "count" will do.
-- What does the execution plan look like?
-- It should be a simple scan of the
-- table (or an index).

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies;


-- Step 3: Alter the table to use parallelism.
-- In Oracle, you can specify the DEGREE of
-- parallelism (the number of query processes).
-- This is the simplest method.

ALTER TABLE PARALLEL (DEGREE 4)


-- Step 4: Run the query again and look at the
-- new execution plan, which should include a
-- PX (parallel execution) coordinator and other
-- PX steps.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM movies;
